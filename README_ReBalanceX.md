# ReBalanceX – AI-Powered Portfolio Rebalancer for Indian Investors

## The Problem
In India, millions of retail investors actively participate in equity markets, mutual funds, and gold-based assets. While these investors often start with a target asset allocation (e.g., 60% equity, 30% debt, 10% gold), they rarely rebalance their portfolios, leading to:

- Overexposure to market volatility  
- Suboptimal risk-adjusted returns  
- Missed tax-efficiency opportunities  
- Emotional or uninformed investment decisions  

The existing solutions for rebalancing are either locked inside premium wealth apps or too manual and fragmented across spreadsheets and platforms.
